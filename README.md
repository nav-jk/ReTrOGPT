# 🕹️ ReTrOGPT

**ReTrOGPT** is a nostalgic, retro-themed adaptation of **GPT-2**, built as a homebrew project. It features a simulated BIOS boot sequence and CRT terminal interface, all wrapped in a vintage aesthetic.

>  **Note:** A custom-trained GPT-2 model is currently under construction and will soon replace the temporary Hugging Face-hosted model.
